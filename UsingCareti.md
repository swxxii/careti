## Usage Overview ##

There are 2 main ways Careti can be used:

  * Install as a Greasemonkey script to enhance all `<textarea>` elements across the web.
  * [Integrate Careti](IntegratingCareti.md) into your own web application.

## Quirks & Usage Notes ##

  * It _will_ work on `<input>` elements but has scrolling issues if there is more text in the box than can be shown. Hence I do not recommend using on `<input>` elements.
  * You really don't want it on all `<input>` elements (think login names).
  * No IE support yet and it's not a priority. If you want it, send me the code.
