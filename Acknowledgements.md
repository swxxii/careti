## Acknowledgements ##

  * Many thanks to _Astro-Boy_ for the original script which I found on [Coding Forums](http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=45976). I have rewritten much of it but the basic architecture is the same.
  * Jim Biacolo et al. for compiling the [list of misspellings](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/).
  * The JavaScript UTF-8 encode/decode is taken from [WebToolKit](http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-utf8.html).
  * Script will use [jshashtable 2.1](http://www.timdown.co.uk/jshashtable/) by Tim Down.
